        "Root Finding centers around finding the root of some function $f(x)$ such that given a value $x$ the function is zero, $f(x_r)=0$. Root finding is important as many scientific applications require finding when the function crosses the $x$ axis. Therefore, understanding efficient computing methods for determining the exact solution or an appropriate approximation to the root is essential. Thus we explore the python libraries to utilize the tools to generate exact or numerical approximations for functions such as $f(x)=x^2-16$ and $f(x)=sin(x)-x$.\n",

It is simply unavoidable as each instrument has a certain limit. Thus every tool and application has a certain amount of error they are willing to accept. This limit is the Tolerance related to measurement and computation. The tolerance is subjective to the project or application. For example an application calculating the average age of their user base will not have a stringent tolerance. Accuracy is necessary to about 2 decimal places in most situations. On the other hand a satellite that calculates the angle of antenna must have a very stringent tolerance as a 4th decimal place change in angle can result in missing the mark by hundreds a meters.\n",
