        "***Integration*** is one of the most important and used mathematical tool used by scientist and engineers. Integration is essential for determing the area under a curve over a given interval. For example the method is often used in mechanical engineering for finding the area of odd shapes which aids in determing the efficiency and effectiveness of a component. Mechanical engineers complete most of their designs on Computer Aided Design programs, thus it is essential for computer scientist and mathematicians to determine an effecitve way of computing an integral. \\\n",

        "***Mathematical Terminology:*** \\\n",
        "Given a function $f(x)$, we can approximate the integral over an interval $[a,b]$. To achieve this computationally, we discretize the interval over a numerical grid $x$ containing $n+1$ points, with space between the poins of $h=\\frac{b-a}{n}$. The common notation is $x_0=a$ and $x_n=b$. It is important to note this is an approximation unless the computer could theoretically compute $n=\\infty$ points or analytically compute the higher derivative function ie. $∫_a^bf(x)dx$. A ***subinterval*** is classified as $[x_i,x_{i+1}]$.\n"
